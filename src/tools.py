    """
    A LangChain-compatible tool for structured product discovery across a grocery catalog and user purchase history.

    This function is decorated with `@tool` to expose it to an LLM agent via LangGraph. It supports SQL-like filtering
    over a product database, optionally constrained to the current user's order history. It returns either individual products
    or group-wise summaries based on the provided arguments.

    ---
    Tool Behavior Overview:
    - Operates on two global pandas DataFrames:
        • `products`: full catalog (from `products.csv`)
        • `prior` + `orders`: user order history (from `order_products__prior.csv`, `orders.csv`)
    - Uses additional joins with `departments.csv` and `aisles.csv` to enrich the product metadata.
    - If `history_only=True`, it will:
        • Look up the current user ID from `get_user_id()`
        • Merge product purchases for that user
        • Calculate statistics like reorder count, order frequency, and cart placement
    - Applies filters conditionally based on which arguments are set.
    - Optionally groups results by department or aisle.

    ---
    Parameters:
    - `product_name` (str, optional): Case-insensitive substring match on product names.
      Example: "almond" → matches "Almond Milk", "Almond Butter".

    - `department` (str, optional): Exact match against department names (from `DEPARTMENT_NAMES`).
      Example: "beverages", "pantry", "produce".

    - `aisle` (str, optional): Lowercased match on aisle name. Example: "organic snacks", "soy milk".

    - `reordered` (bool, optional): Only meaningful if `history_only=True`.
      - `True` → return only products reordered at least once
      - `False` → return products bought once, never reordered

    - `min_orders` (int, optional): Only meaningful if `history_only=True`.
      Filters for items purchased this many times or more.

    - `order_by` (str, optional): Only meaningful if `history_only=True`.
      - `"count"` → total times product was ordered
      - `"add_to_cart_order"` → average position in cart

    - `ascending` (bool, optional): Whether to sort `order_by` field ascending (default is `False` = descending).

    - `top_k` (int, optional): After filtering and sorting, returns only the top K products.

    - `group_by` (str, optional): If set to `"department"` or `"aisle"`, aggregates and returns counts instead of product rows.

    - `history_only` (bool, optional):
      - If `True`, only includes items the current user has purchased.
      - If `False` (default), searches the full catalog.

    ---
    Dependencies:
    - Requires global variables: `products`, `departments`, `aisles`, `prior`, `orders`
    - Requires user ID to be set via `set_user_id(user_id)` if `history_only=True`
    - Reads from CSVs under `./dataset/`

    ---
    Examples:
    ➤ Example 1: Find catalog items in pantry containing "peanut"
    ```json
    {
        "product_name": "peanut",
        "department": "pantry"
    }
    ```

    ➤ Example 2: Show reordered pantry products in my history
    ```json
    {
        "department": "pantry",
        "reordered": true,
        "history_only": true
    }
    ```

    ➤ Example 3: Top 5 most frequent purchases by user
    ```json
    {
        "order_by": "count",
        "top_k": 5,
        "history_only": true
    }
    ```

    ➤ Example 4: Count of catalog items by department
    ```json
    {
        "group_by": "department"
    }
    ```

    ---
    Returns:
    - If `group_by` is used:
      A list of dicts like:
      ```json
      [{"department": "pantry", "num_products": 132}, {"department": "beverages", "num_products": 89}]
      ```

    - Otherwise:
      A list of dicts, each with:
      ```json
      {
        "product_id": 24852,
        "product_name": "Organic Bananas",
        "aisle": "fresh fruits",
        "department": "produce",
        ... (optionally "count", "reordered", etc. if history_only=True)
      }
      ```

    - If no matches found, returns an empty list.
    - If required fields (e.g. user ID) are missing, returns a list with an error dict.

    LLM Usage Note:
    This tool is ideal for filtered browsing, purchase history analysis, or category breakdowns.

    Tool-decorated function that performs semantic product search using vector similarity,

    This function is registered as a LangChain tool using the `@tool` decorator. It is intended
    for natural language queries from users looking for relevant products. Internally, it wraps
    `search_products(...)`, which uses a sentence embedding model and vector database.

    ---
    Tool Decorator:
    - This function is wrapped with `@tool` so that it can be invoked by an LLM agent during
      LangGraph execution when choosing from available tools.

    ---
    Arguments:
    - query (str): A free-form natural language string describing what the user is looking for.
      Examples:
        - "high protein vegan snacks"
        - "easy breakfast foods"
        - "organic almond butter"

    ---
    Internal Behavior:
    - Calls `search_products(query: str)` to perform semantic vector search.
    - The `search_products()` function:
        • Uses `make_query_prompt()` to convert the query into a format suitable for embedding.
        • Embeds the prompt using a HuggingFace sentence transformer.
        • Calls `get_vector_store()` to get a Chroma DB.
        • Returns metadata-rich matches including ID, name, aisle, department, and description.
    - The results (if any) are converted into a multi-line formatted string showing:
        - Product name and ID
        - Aisle and Department
        - Text description from vector DB

    ---
    Returns:
    - If products found:
        A formatted multiline string:
        ```
        - Organic Granola (ID: 18872)
          Aisle: Cereal
          Department: Breakfast

    - If no products found:

    Build a LangGraph ToolNode that can handle errors gracefully using a fallback strategy.

    This function should create a ToolNode that wraps a list of tools and attaches
    a fallback mechanism using LangChain's `with_fallbacks(...)` method.

    ---
    Requirements:
    - Return a `ToolNode` from `langgraph.prebuilt`.
    - Attach a fallback using `.with_fallbacks(...)` with your error handler.
    - Use `handle_tool_error(state)` as the fallback function.
    - Set `exception_key="error"` so LangGraph recognizes failure states.

    ---
    Arguments:
    - tools (list): A list of @tool-decorated functions (LangChain tools).

    ---
    Returns:
    - ToolNode: A LangGraph-compatible tool node with error fallback logic.
